# s-p500invester
This app tells you how many stocks to buy of each of the stocks on the S&amp;P 500 list (all 505) assuming that you have a pool of money that you want to distribute equally amongst them.
There are also some other random tests that I did throughout that you may see commented out.  I'll perhaps work on this a bit more, have perhaps craft some additional features, and then perhaps consider adding it to the main Finance Framework application on which I've been working.
