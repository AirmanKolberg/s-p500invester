# S&P 500 Invester
This app tells you how many stocks to buy of each of the stocks on the S&amp;P 500 list (all 505) assuming that you have a pool of money that you want to distribute equally amongst them.
There are also some other random tests that I did throughout that you may see commented out.  I'll perhaps work on this a bit more, have perhaps craft some additional features, and then perhaps consider adding it to the main Finance Framework application on which I've been working.

# Update, 22Dec2020
I've taken out the entire S&P 500 and just started swapping for random stocks that I've selected.  As I progress, I want this bot to simulate a few trading strategies that I am formulating before I hand it some money and see where it takes me.  Updates will follow, as per usual!

# Update, 23Dec2020
The app needs to be heavily re-written, as it became quite repetitive in my efforts to get the bot to work.  It is now working, I have the bot playing with $6,000 for kicks, and I will be continuing as I go.  At this point, the bot will buy/sell a load of stocks, so long as it'll make $1 or more doing so.  Not a good strategy at all, obviously, but the tests are working.

# Update, 27Dec2020
I've changed the stock strings within the stocks list from strings to calls to their respective Class Objects.  I figured it'd be much easier (and more efficient) this way, as I can now run through each Class Object in a for Loop!  [shaka emoji]

# Part 2 of 27Dec2020 Update
All right, the app is completed, and the for Loop going through the Class Objects has been implemented!
